This Python-based application enables seamless file transfers between up to five computers within a local area network (LAN). Designed with a client-server architecture, the system ensures efficient data transmission, allowing users to share files without relying on external cloud services.

The project focuses on speed, reliability, and scalability, implementing multi-threaded communication to handle multiple transfer requests simultaneously. With a lightweight yet robust design, it provides a practical solution for local file sharing in controlled network environments.
